# Iris Recognition using Machine Learning

This project implements an **Iris Flower Recognition System** using **Machine Learning**.  
It predicts the species of an Iris flower based on physical measurements.

The model classifies flowers into:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

---

## Features Used
The prediction is made using these four flower features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

---

## Machine Learning Algorithm
This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Machine Learning (Classification)

---

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** from Scikit-learn is used.  
It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features and 3 output classes.

##  How to Run This Project

### Step 1 – Install required libraries
### Step 2 – Train the model
This will generate:
### Step 3 – Test the model
---

##  Purpose of This Project
This project was created to demonstrate:
- Machine Learning model training
- Classification using SVM
- Model saving and prediction
